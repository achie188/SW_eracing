    #### Race Report - AstraZenaca

    A tough night for the Trailfinders.

    Camp was very upbeat leading up to the season opener. The new faces had settled in nicely and they’d put together a more than respectable set of prologue times. And 
    instead of the habitual pre-race panic, there was an air of serenity in the group. Confidence was high.

    New signing Foley, in particular, was chomping at the bit to prove his worth to the sponsors. He was in great shape and he knew it. He was straight out into the breakaway, 
    going toe to toe with the mercurial Monkfish. 

    Unfortunately, the rest of the team were no match for ‘Foley Fever’. Friend, Lopez and Tyler looked well short of last season’s form. The diamonds they once had in their 
    legs, had turned into thick, gloopy, treacle. Normally so reliable in the sprint, they were caught at the back of the peloton reminiscing over former glories. Singh did 
    fight hard on the climb, but his lungs were soon full of toxic levels of Volcanic ash and that was his day done. Wilson was perhaps the bravest of the Trailfinders tonight – 
    this was her first race as a professional, and she was shown no mercy by the cut-throat Amazonian prime captain, Dix. 

    Lego Boots – with the race director in their ranks – were unstoppable tonight and deserve real credit. With their big budget and unlimited supply of baby oil, they’ve 
    cemented their reputation as the bookie’s favourites.  Foley, Tesla captain Humphreys, and Amazon debutant Warmachine – were all up there at the business end…but they 
    couldn’t quite get hold of those slippery Boots out front. 

    It'll be a restless night for the AZ Trailfinders there’s no doubt about it. But we’re only in week 1. And as the old saying goes, you can’t lose it in week 1. Can you?

    #### Race Report - Tesla

    Go go go. George Dix is flying at the front of the race. His team behind them. They look amazing in their Amazon Prime blue jerseys. Dixy is so angry you can tell by 
    looking at his electronic avatar. Why the hell are they going so fast.

    Meanwhile the Tesla Thames Water team with sponsors hell bent on rehabilitating their reputation look formidable in our red T jerseys! Looking comfortable we were all 
    present and corrrect with Scottie up in the break feeding us live information on Chris Monk’s state of mind. 

    We appproached Mount doom looming in the distance like a bunch of super charged hobbits who have got to get back to the shire in time for Old Gaffer Gamgee’s mutton 
    eating competition.

    The sprint came and went with no one on our team clear where the sprint was and our main sprinter Edwin unable to hear the rest of us which led to a comical if not 
    frustrating 3 mins of people shouting into the wind and Ed smith sprinting at anything he could see.

    Anyway the real quiz came along pretty sharpish and the pack was set. About half way some bastard launched themselves and the pack was split and only one TTW was in 
    the front group, me. Scottie was quickly gobbled up and spat out and up ahead Chris Monk continued to forge on in his skin tight orange jersey. 

    We reached the top and toppled over the edge. I found myself in a group of 2 chasing Tom and Chris up ahead. I worked as hard as I could to stave off any chance of the 
    group behind catching and James Warman sat neatly behind like Frodo to my Sam. We were catching Chris but would run out of road and so we were fighting for 3rd place. 
    Just like in the books at the last minute Frodo snuck past Sam and took the win. 

    The remainder of the TTWs fellowship rolled in happily as a group bruised but in no way beaten. 

    The old truism was muttered over comms..
    ‘The winners of week 1 have never won the season!’ 

    Someone belched loudly

    They come thick and fast. Like home secretaries, prime ministers or next door’s cat. The races keep coming. This week the course was flat and a sprinters stage ... or was it. 
    We had no idea. 

    Teo pulled a fast one again claiming he was a dead duck but he managed to stop and change bike, take a work call and yet once again proved that he’s the best sprinter in 
    all of the Walrus expanded universe. James Warman bravely blasted on in the break solo to collect those valuable points at the second sprint. But the real battle was behind 
    him as the group largely stayed together for much of the race and we had 5 men in the pack. Things were looking up. Sprint 1 came and went and Sprint 2 came and went and 
    Lawrence Lagnado proved himself a worthy competitor picking up points. Poor old Ed Smith couldn't get his motor going and apologised profusely saying that he was just nervous 
    and this hasn't happened to him before. We said that it was ok and we could just cuddle. 

    It all went off at some point later in the race ... before the KOM somewhere but I can't remember ... I was blind with sweat as my fan had moved and was neatly pointing directly 
    at the other fan ... maybe that worked in some way. We still had men in the front but then the KOM came and I managed to surge forward and end up in a group with 2 others ahead of 
    a chasing pack. I thought about carrying on but my eyes as previously stated were in poor condtion and I couldn't see what gap we had. I could tell though that Shyam was in 
    the pack behind honestly sticking to the wheels of the big guys. They caught us with a km to go and there was a shoot out amongst the usual suspects. Teo, Dixy and the 
    new man on the scene - Lego Jesus Nick Foley. I manged to get 3rd spot just pipping Dixy and Shyam placed nicely behind somewhere.
