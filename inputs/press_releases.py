    For years the top team at Lego have been considering a move into the world of pro cycling. And this year, they have finally taken the plunge, emptied their pockets, 
    gathered up the scattered pennies, and spent them on a pro e-cycling outfit.

    To do so they have teamed up with Boots. It feels like an odd combination, (and a few stories have circulated about how the CFO at Boots was taken out for a lobster 
    lunch by a few Lego directors. It transpired the CFO was on the way out of the company anyway, got totally pissed, and ended up signing up to the agreement muttering 
    “fuck it all” under his breath). 

    Despite the coming together of these two behemoths, Lego Boots have been struggling to raise the cash to entice one rider in particular: Bill Smith.  According to 
    reliable sources, Bill was demanding an extortionate salary, and therefore a third title sponsor had to be found at short notice. Some big names were interested, 
    but time was cripplingly short, and the best the Lego Boots partnership could do was P&O ferries, who gladly provided the extra cash to secure the services of the 
    hardened professional Bill Smith (despite P&O knowing that P&O was bound to be left off the title name when used by Adam Blythe on GCN commentary). 

    As part of Bill’s contract, he had demanded that he would need a full team to support him in his GC bid, and insisted it would be “all in for Bill”.  So what was 
    needed was domestiques willing to turn themselves inside out, upside down, and over the hill and far away for Bill, week in, week out. 

    To do this, Lego Boots immediately crawled all over the decaying carcass of what was previously Routes Coffee TZA Draconi. And like a hungry vulture, they picked up 
    nearly the whole squad that had previously been punching holes in walls for the ‘Al brothers’.  

    With contracts expired, and the wise heads of Al and Al now out the picture, Lizzy, Nic, Tom and Tom were happy to sign up to Lego Boots and look for new opportunities
      of their own. (Little did they know Bill Smith had his own designs as to what they would be allowed to do on the road.)

    With a dwindling purse, Lego Boots still had spots in their rooster to fill. Wetbeak and Monk, a couple of older riders well past their peak, were brought on board. 
    Largely because no other team would take them, and Lego Boots is paying them peanuts. 

    And the final spot went to Alex Hadcock. A talented climber, but a neo-pro and totally untested in the heated world of Walrus e-cycling. Some say this deal was a gamble,
    Lego Boots would say this deal was cheap as chips. 

    Only time will tell how delicious those chips will be.

    In a groundbreaking collaboration that defies expectations, Tesla, the pioneering electric car company, and Thames Water, the UK's leading water utility provider, have 
    joined forces to propel the world of professional cycling into a new era.

    The partnership was officially unveiled at a press conference attended by Elon Musk, the visionary CEO of Tesla, and Alastair Cochran, the forward-thinking CEO of Thames 
    Water. Their announcement marks a significant moment in the history of cycling as the two seemingly unrelated giants pool their resources to launch a brand-new cycling 
    team: Team Tesla Thames Water.

    This unique partnership is set to bring a fresh perspective to the world of professional cycling, as Tesla's commitment to clean energy and innovation marries Thames 
    Water's dedication to responsible water management. The unlikely union underscores the shared ambition to conquer the 2023 Zwift Championships, one of the most prestigious 
    events in the cycling calendar.

    In a surprising twist, the newly formed Team Tesla Thames Water has signed Rich Tyler, a rising star in the cycling world, to bolster their roster. Known for his remarkable 
    sprinting skills and podium finishes, Tyler is poised to be a key asset in the team's pursuit of championship glory.

    However, the team's lineup isn't complete without the enigmatic Edwin Smith, a mercurial talent whose career has spanned decades. The question on everyone's mind is 
    whether Smith, now considered "long in the tooth" by some, still possesses the prowess to contribute to the team's quest for victory. His inclusion adds an element of 
    intrigue to the team's composition.

    When asked about the partnership, Elon Musk stated, "Cycling is more than just sport; it's a symbol of human potential and the power of sustainable transportation. Our 
    partnership with Thames Water aims to underscore the importance of preserving our planet's resources, just as we do with electric vehicles. Team Tesla Thames Water is 
    not just a cycling team; it's a testament to our shared commitment to a greener future."

    Alastair Cochran, CEO of Thames Water, added, "As stewards of water, we understand the significance of responsible resource management. Joining forces with Tesla is a 
    declaration that our actions speak louder than words. We're excited about the journey ahead, both on the road and in our shared mission to champion sustainability."

    The team's distinctive blue and green jerseys symbolize the fusion of electric energy and water, while reflecting their dedication to clean, renewable energy sources. It's 
    a visual reminder of their commitment to a more sustainable future.

    Team Tesla Thames Water also announced an exciting partnership with Scott bikes and Volvo cars to elevate their on-road and off-road experiences. Sunweb remains a valued 
    partner, ensuring the team's continued growth and success.

    With the 2023 Zwift Championships on the horizon, Team Tesla Thames Water's journey promises to be a thrilling blend of competition and commitment to the environment, 
    as they ride towards a future where sport and sustainability go hand in hand.

    In a surprising twist in the world of SW eracing, the remnants of the infamous Evil Greens have found a new lease of life through a partnership between AstraZeneca 
    and Trailfinders. This unexpected alliance was driven by a unique vision: AstraZeneca's aspiration to invest more in Watopian diseases whilst supporting washed up Greens' 
    bruiser, Teo Lopez.

    Now captain Lopez had endured a challenging summer, having been attacked by a swarm of extremely venomous Watopian feather beetles, on a late season training ride. His 
    personal journey resonated with AstraZeneca's mission, and the addition of Trailfinders was perfect for this new, intrepid, outfit.

    Vice Captain Dickie Tyler will play a crucial role in maintaining team morale and optimising strategy, whilst seasoned veterans, Rob Friend and Duncan Singh, bring a 
    wealth of experience and camaraderie. Duncan Singh aptly remarked, "We might be 'wily old heads,' but we still have a few tricks up our sleeves."

    The team welcoms fresh faces, including Davyd Greenish, who excitedly declared, "I'm thrilled to be part of this team!" Beth Wilson and Nick Foley add youthful enthusiasm 
    and unpredictability to the squad.

    This partnership not only breathes new life into the Greens but also signifies a unique fusion of goals – AstraZeneca's commitment to Watopian diseases and the resilience 
    and determination of the once-feared Evil Greens. It's a story of renewal and hope, anchored by the experienced, the determined, and the newcomers, all propelled forward 
    by a shared mission to make a meaningful impact in the e-racing world.

    The cycling world was turned on its head this week as Amazon and Beaconsfield Services formed an unlikely yet captivating collaboration, plunging headlong into the realm 
    of professional cycling. George Dix, the former maestro of the Evil Greens, takes the reins, leading a spirited squad backed by the e-commerce juggernaut and the local 
    services heroes.

    Whispers abound about the genesis of this unexpected partnership, with a tantalizing suggestion that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and one of the wealthiest individuals 
    globally, found himself entangled in a brief but intense affair with a Beaconsfield cashier during a UK business sojourn a few months ago. While the exact details of 
    this encounter remain shrouded in mystery, there are rumours of a Postman Pat fairground ride, a liquid lunch, and a pair of rubber bands. Legend has it that Bezos, 
    quite literally caught with his pants down, brokered a deal, offering support for Beaconsfield Services' pro cycling aspirations in exchange for absolute confidentiality.

    Now armed with a formidable purse, Beaconsfield Services wasted no time in assembling a stellar lineup. George Dix, along with new recruits Warman, Graley, and Thompson, 
    inked deals within the inaugural week of the team's inception. The seasoned pro, Henry Courtier, was lured out of retirement after Prime committed to spotlighting the team's 
    quest for glory as part of the upcoming documentary on the Sexy Walrus E-Racing series - Spandex and Shenanigans.
