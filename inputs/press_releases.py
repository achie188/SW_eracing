        For years the top team at Lego have been considering a move into the world of pro cycling. And this year, they have finally taken the plunge, emptied their pockets, gathered up the scattered pennies, and spent them on a pro e-cycling outfit.

        To do so they have teamed up with Boots. It feels like an odd combination, (and a few stories have circulated about how the CFO at Boots was taken out for a lobster lunch by a few Lego directors. It transpired the CFO was on the way out of the company anyway, got totally pissed, and ended up signing up to the agreement muttering “fuck it all” under his breath). 

        Despite the coming together of these two behemoths, Lego Boots have been struggling to raise the cash to entice one rider in particular: Bill Smith.  According to reliable sources, Bill was demanding an extortionate salary, and therefore a third title sponsor had to be found at short notice. Some big names were interested, but time was cripplingly short, and the best the Lego Boots partnership could do was P&O ferries, who gladly provided the extra cash to secure the services of the hardened professional Bill Smith,(despite P&O knowing that P&O was bound to be left off the title name when used by Adam Bylthe on GCN commentary). 

        As part of Bill’s contract, he had demanded that he would need a full team to support him in his GC bid, and insisted it would be “all in for Bill”.  So what was needed was domestiques willing to turn themselves inside out, upside down, and over the hill and far away for Bill, week in, week out. 

        To do this, Lego Boots immediately crawled all over the decaying carcass of what was previously Routes Coffee TZA Draconi. And like a hungry vulture, they picked up nearly the whole squad that had previously been punching holes in walls for the ‘Al brothers’.  

        With contracts expired, and the wise heads of Al and Al now out the picture, Lizzy, Nic, Tom and Tom were happy to sign up to Lego Boots and look for new opportunities of their own. (Little did they know Bill Smith had his own designs as to what they would be allowed to do on the road.)

        With a dwindling purse, Lego Boots still had spots in their rooster to fill. Wetbeak and Monk, a couple of older riders well past their peak, were brought on board. Largely because no other team would take them, and Lego Boots is paying them peanuts. 

        And the final spot went to Alex Hadcock. A talented climber, but a neo-pro and totally untested in the heated world of Walrus e-cycling. Some say this deal was a gamble, Lego Boots would say this deal was cheap as chips. 

        Only time will tell how delicious those chips will be.
