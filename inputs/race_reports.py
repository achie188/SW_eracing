    A tough night for the Trailfinders.

    Camp was very upbeat leading up to the season opener. The new faces had settled in nicely and they’d put together a more than respectable set of prologue times. And 
    instead of the habitual pre-race panic, there was an air of serenity in the group. Confidence was high.

    New signing Foley, in particular, was chomping at the bit to prove his worth to the sponsors. He was in great shape and he knew it. He was straight out into the breakaway, 
    going toe to toe with the mercurial Monkfish. 

    Unfortunately, the rest of the team were no match for ‘Foley Fever’. Friend, Lopez and Tyler looked well short of last season’s form. The diamonds they once had in their 
    legs, had turned into thick, gloopy, treacle. Normally so reliable in the sprint, they were caught at the back of the peloton reminiscing over former glories. Singh did 
    fight hard on the climb, but his lungs were soon full of toxic levels of Volcanic ash and that was his day done. Wilson was perhaps the bravest of the Trailfinders tonight – 
    this was her first race as a professional, and she was shown no mercy by the cut-throat Amazonian prime captain, Dix. 

    Lego Boots – with the race director in their ranks – were unstoppable tonight and deserve real credit. With their big budget and unlimited supply of baby oil, they’ve 
    cemented their reputation as the bookie’s favourites.  Foley, Tesla captain Humphreys, and Amazon debutant Warmachine – were all up there at the business end…but they 
    couldn’t quite get hold of those slippery Boots out front. 

    It'll be a restless night for the AZ Trailfinders there’s no doubt about it. But we’re only in week 1. And as the old saying goes, you can’t lose it in week 1. Can you?

    Go go go. George Dix is flying at the front of the race. His team behind them. They look amazing in their Amazon Prime blue jerseys. Dixy is so angry you can tell by 
    looking at his electronic avatar. Why the hell are they going so fast.

    Meanwhile the Tesla Thames Water team with sponsors hell bent on rehabilitating their reputation look formidable in our red T jerseys! Looking comfortable we were all 
    present and corrrect with Scottie up in the break feeding us live information on Chris Monk’s state of mind. 

    We appproached Mount doom looming in the distance like a bunch of super charged hobbits who have got to get back to the shire in time for Old Gaffer Gamgee’s mutton 
    eating competition.

    The sprint came and went with no one on our team clear where the sprint was and our main sprinter Edwin unable to hear the rest of us which led to a comical if not 
    frustrating 3 mins of people shouting into the wind and Ed smith sprinting at anything he could see.

    Anyway the real quiz came along pretty sharpish and the pack was set. About half way some bastard launched themselves and the pack was split and only one TTW was in 
    the front group, me. Scottie was quickly gobbled up and spat out and up ahead Chris Monk continued to forge on in his skin tight orange jersey. 

    We reached the top and toppled over the edge. I found myself in a group of 2 chasing Tom and Chris up ahead. I worked as hard as I could to stave off any chance of the 
    group behind catching and James Warman sat neatly behind like Frodo to my Sam. We were catching Chris but would run out of road and so we were fighting for 3rd place. 
    Just like in the books at the last minute Frodo snuck past Sam and took the win. 

    The remainder of the TTWs fellowship rolled in happily as a group bruised but in no way beaten. 

    The old truism was muttered over comms..
    ‘The winners of week 1 have never won the season!’ 

    Someone belched loudly

    They come thick and fast. Like home secretaries, prime ministers or next door’s cat. The races keep coming. This week the course was flat and a sprinters stage ... or was it. 
    We had no idea. 

    Teo pulled a fast one again claiming he was a dead duck but he managed to stop and change bike, take a work call and yet once again proved that he’s the best sprinter in 
    all of the Walrus expanded universe. James Warman bravely blasted on in the break solo to collect those valuable points at the second sprint. But the real battle was behind 
    him as the group largely stayed together for much of the race and we had 5 men in the pack. Things were looking up. Sprint 1 came and went and Sprint 2 came and went and 
    Lawrence Lagnado proved himself a worthy competitor picking up points. Poor old Ed Smith couldn't get his motor going and apologised profusely saying that he was just nervous 
    and this hasn't happened to him before. We said that it was ok and we could just cuddle. 

    It all went off at some point later in the race ... before the KOM somewhere but I can't remember ... I was blind with sweat as my fan had moved and was neatly pointing directly 
    at the other fan ... maybe that worked in some way. We still had men in the front but then the KOM came and I managed to surge forward and end up in a group with 2 others ahead of 
    a chasing pack. I thought about carrying on but my eyes as previously stated were in poor condtion and I couldn't see what gap we had. I could tell though that Shyam was in 
    the pack behind honestly sticking to the wheels of the big guys. They caught us with a km to go and there was a shoot out amongst the usual suspects. Teo, Dixy and the 
    new man on the scene - Lego Jesus Nick Foley. I manged to get 3rd spot just pipping Dixy and Shyam placed nicely behind somewhere.

    Twas a balmy night in the Highlands  
    The lads and the lassies lined up on their steeds  
    A breakaway let loose like a trio of stallions  
    Left the rest of the pack on their their knees  

    Wetbeak cried oot and the race was on  
    'cross rolling hills and past the old loch  
    But the breakway was steadfast and powerful  
    Warman driving the front, thighs of rock  

    Tween lap 2 and lap 3 he shed his deadweight foe  
    Would he stay away? It felt though he might  
    But with the climb up the Brae looming ahead  
    The brave laddie finally conceded the fight  

    The victory haggis went to House Lopez  
    That dastardly team knows no bounds  
    The neeps and the tatties taken by Tesla, Amazon & Lego  
    And the rest of us thrown to the hounds  

    But let's not forget about Warman  
    The braveheart, he fought to the end  
    Rolled over the line only few seconds down  
    Now his legs have a week to mend  

    And on that note, see yous next week  
    I'm sure you'll be back for more  
    There may nae be haggis, or Saltires, or midges  
    But there certainly will be war

    After a tough opening week, Team AstraZeneca Trailfinders were under pressure from sponsors to perform, and perform they did. 

    After a couple of k’s of chaos, with team captain Teo Lopez stopping for an early bike change, the soon-to-become iconic striped jerseys had a strong presence at the 
    front and controlled the pace nicely, letting Chris Monk occasionally shoot off the front to give his sponsors the exposure in the orange jersey and salute the lines 
    of adoring fans.

    The first sprint started nervously, no one wanting to go first until Teo thought 'bugger this for a bunch of bananas' and accelerated out of the pack causing pandemonium 
    behind him as everyone scrambled in vain to reel him in. 

    Everyone was a lot more prepared for the 2nd sprint and Teo was unable to stay away being pipped at the post by G Dix. However there were other positives for AZT with 
    Nick Foley coming in 5th with the calm grace of an Oxford undergraduate popping out for a pint of milk. 

    From that sprint the race really got going with the front end not slowing down and dropping anyone who had not been challenging for the sprint or who were foolish 
    enough to think that they could easy off after the banner.
    
    Soon the front group were up and passed the KOM as if it wasn’t there, with Nick Foley hitting the summit in 2nd. Teo rode a superb captain’s ride leading out Nick, 
    now a bona fide GC contender. Teo’s effort could be heard on discord with every pedal stroke accompanied by a pant and a growl while Nick sauntered along in his wake 
    still looking for Cowley Road Co-Op. They crossed the line 1st and 2nd. The Captain taking the stage win and Nick securing 2nd in the GC a little over a minute behind 
    Chris Monk. 

    The Trailfinders are back!

    It was a rushed start as the wife had gone out and left me to deal with the children and their stupid needs. But I made it in time and had just enough breath to brief 
    the team - go hard, keep going and then do some more.

    Teo had spent the week trying to gaslight the rest of us into thinking that this was a hilly stage. However his efforts were in vain as it was quite clear that it was 
    in fact the flattest course one can do. 

    So 35mins ahead of a tired bunch of Teslons chasing the break and then watching Teo storm the glory by a huge margin like Cav on the Champs Elise. And that’s exactly 
    what happens of course. We tried our best and managed to pull in the break and compete for some sprints but it all played out exactly as we thought it would. 

    Sadly though it seems that Chris Monk was the subject of a bizarre mid race police raid and managed to loose a good 30 seconds on GC, which is good news for the chasers.

    Onto next week!

    Notes from Lego Boots P&O debrief meeting with sponsors.

    I was sat at the head of the table, but it didn’t feel like an honour. On the left flank sat the Boots executives: bespectacled, overweight, spotty and nervously 
    smirking. On the right flank sat an enormous man in his late 40s.  He was in a fading blue suit, with sweat patches under the arms. He smelt abominable. And he was 
    fast asleep. He was, of course, the CEO of P&O Ferries. 

    Sat opposite me at the far end of the table sat Lego Batman. With Lego Ironman on his right and Lego Harry Potter on his left. The Lego men were not smiling. They 
    never were. Whenever I met them, they always made sure their smiling faces were turned around facing backwards, so all I would ever see were their stern, frowning 
    aces on the other side of their heads. 

    Lego Batman stared at me for the longest of times, but it was Lego Harry Potter that spoke first.  

    “So what the fucking fuck happened?”

    “Well … I … thought it went rather well” I stammered. 

    “We’re not paying for ‘rather well’” growled Lego Ironman. 

    I ignored this, and carried on with my debrief. “Well it started well enough. We had someone in the break, and it looked like Tesla couldn’t give a toss whether it 
    was brought back or not. To be honest, we thought Lizzy might make it all the way”

    Lego Batman stood up at this point and screamed. “BUT SHE DIDN’T FUCKING MAKE IT DID SHE.” I hadn’t realised before quite how high pitched Lego Batman’s voice was. 
    And how loud as well.

    “FUCKING LAYTON DID. DIDN’T HE’” 

    I was determined to stand up for me and my team. “Well, to be frank, sir,”

    “CALL ME LEGO BATMAN SIR”

    “Sorry. Well to be frank, Mr Lego Batman Sir, we are fairly suspicious about the equipment that Layton is using. To be able to solo off to victory like that. Surely he’s 
    got a motor in that bike somewhere.” 

    There was a spluttering cough from somewhere. One of the Boots directors was shuffling papers, whilst another was vigorously flipping through massive sheets of graphs 
    and numbers. Then a grunting sound manifested into a human voice. It was Susan, who had been placed in charge of the Boots investment in the team. 
    
    “Be that as it may, and investigations are continuing around that. We are monitoring the Team Captains extremely closely. George Dix is a suspicious character, clearly dodgy as 
    fuck and will do anything to win. We are working on flipping some informants in other teams and hope to be able to take evidence to the SW Arbitration Council soon and enforce 
    some penalties.” 
    
    She continued, “But Andy Layton and his impressive equipment aside, you still didn’t finish on the podium did you?” 

    A pause. 

    “Not on the podium.  Not even in the top 5 …” 
    
    Lego Batman started repeatedly hammering on the table at this point. He hammered so hard his hand popped right off, and Lego Harry Potter had to scuttle off the corner 
    of the room to retrieve it. 

    "Why do you think we sponsored a team in this event? This race is CLEARLY corrupt and ripe for opportunities. 3 of the 4 Team Captains are the top scoring individuals across the
    series for fuck's sake. And where are you Wetbeak?"

    "I don't have that information to hand Mr Lego Batman Sir."

    "SUSAN!?"

    "Wetbeak is currently 8th in the Championship Mr Lego Batman Sir."

    "8th. Fucking 8th. What is the fucking point in investing millions into a corrupt event if we pick the only straight shooter in the whole fucking gig?!"

    I didn't answer. It seemed like a rhetorical question. Lego Harry Potter spoke next.

    "Teo Lopez spends more time negotiating his weight handicap that looking after his own child. We have video survelliance from inside his own house of him nearly killing 
    the baby whilst attempting to get ready for this weeks race whilst his wife was away. We are considering leaking this at some stage to his close family. But this is for us to 
    deal with. Wetbeak, we expect more from you in future races. As Team Captain the buck stops with you."
    
    The P&O ogre still didn’t stir. 

    My will was breaking, but I kept up my defences. “Well that may be the case, but Monky kept his Orange Jersey, despite missing out on the key break. And when the split 
    happened, we actually had 4 riders on the good side of it, so at that stage we were feeling pretty good and things. And Bill Smith came in 6th in the end, and picked up 
    all sorts of goodies in the intermediates.”

    The mention of Bill awakened the repulsive P&O man. “Blarrgh.” He blurted, with a healthy amount of saliva overflowing down his chin. “Bloody good ride from Bill wasn’t 
    it? Bloody good rider that Bill. Bloody good.” He fell fast asleep again. 

    I felt I was softening up the Lego men now, so I continued. “And we didn’t know the other teams were bringing in some hired guns. Those Greenish brothers are wild animals, 
    and Coote is clearly a hired thug. And where the fucking hell has this one called The Crow come from?!”

    A silence floated around the room like a released balloon blowing gently on the wind. Until Lego Harry Potter popped it. 

    “Let me be clear, Wetbeak. We don’t pay for second place. And right now, you and your team are in second place.  I suggest you go away, and think of some plan as to how 
    you’re going to defeat these Amazonians, these AstraZenecas, these Teslas, and all the mercenaries they can muster. We don’t care how you do it. Just get it done. Or else” 

    And at that, the Lego men got up, and walked away (not before turning their heads back around now, so their stern faces could continue to look at me as they left the room.).
    
    I sat, contemplating the meeting for a while. And smiled. I had a plan ...'''
